## Obective
The objective of this exercise will be to learn commands in MATLAB that would be used to reduce linear systems block diagram using series, parallel and feedback configuration.

### Example 1: Series Configuration

Given the transfer functions of individual blocks generate the system transfer
function of the block combinations.

### Example 2: Parallel Configuration
If the two blocks are connected as shown below then the blocks are said to be in parallel. It would like adding two transfer functions.

### Example 3: Feedback
Given a unity feedback system as shown in the figure, obtain the overall transfer function.

### Example 4: FeedBack Non-Unity
Given a non-unity feedback system as shown in the figure, obtain the overall transfer function.

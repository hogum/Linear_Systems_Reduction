##### Exercise 1: 
For the following multi-loop feedback system, get closed loop transfer function and the corresponding pole-zero map of the system.


##### Exercise 2: Consider the feedback system depicted in the figure below 
    a. Compute the closed-loop transfer function using the ‘series’ and ‘feedback’ functions 
    b. Obtain the closed-loop system unit step response with the ‘step’ function and verify that final value of the output is 2/5.


##### Exercise  3:  A  satellite  single-axis  altitude  control  system  can  be  represented  by  the block diagram in the figure given. The variables ‘k’, ‘a’ and ‘b’ are controller parameters, and ‘J’ is the spacecraft moment of inertia. Suppose the nominal moment of inertia is ‘J’ = 10.8E8, and the controller parameters are k=10.8E8, a=1, and b=8.

    a. Develop an m-file script to compute the closed-loop transfer function  
    b. Compute and plot the step response to a 10o step input. 
    c. The exact moment of inertia is generally unknown and may change slowly with time. Compare the step response performance of the spacecraft when J is reduced by 20% and 50%. Discuss your results.
